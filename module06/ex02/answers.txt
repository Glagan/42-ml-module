1. We add a column of 1 to the left of the x vector to have the correct matrix dimension to do a multiplication with the theta vector, and it's filled with 1 so it ignores theta0.
2. The distance between data points is squared so it ignores negative and positive values order.
3. The cost function output represent the squared distance between the predicted result and the real result.
4. We want the cost function output to reach 0, which would mean that all of the predicitions match perfectly the real result.
5. Matrix multiplication are not commutative because the dimensions of the matrices could not be valid when their position in the multiplication are reversed.
