# Module 06

Questions answers:

> **What is a hypothesis and what is its goal ?**  
> The hypothesis is the prediction of a given value according to some parameters. It's goal is to predict a value.

> **What is the loss function and what does it represent ?**  
> The cost function represent the cost of a given prediction and it's real value.

> **What is Linear Gradient Descent and what does it do ? (hint: you have to talk about J, its gradient and the theta parameters...)**  
> Linear Gradient Descent is an iterative algorithm to calculate the global minimum of a given function using it's derivative.

> **hat happens if you choose a learning rate that is too large ?**  
> A learning rate too large could make the Gradient Descent never converge or even increase over time since it would take steps too big.

> **What happens if you choose a very small learning rate, but still a sufficient number of cycles ?**  
> A small learning could make the convergence really slow.

> **Can you explain MSE and what it measures ?**  
> **MSE** means **Mean Squared Error**, it's the distance between a prediction and it's real value, and it's used as the cost function.
